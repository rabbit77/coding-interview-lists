# coding-interview-lists
ðŸ’€ Recording what I've learned for preparing for interview.
Recently I've learned so much knowledge about coding. But the more I learn, more anxious I feel. 
Yesterday, I saw a man preparing for google interview write a list, to record what he learned.
Therefore, I thought I should record what I've learned, too.
So I create this repository.
